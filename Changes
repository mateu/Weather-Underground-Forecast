          Fixes:
          - Use default property for source_URL instead of a lazy builder propery.
            This is an attempt to keep some CPAN testers from getting an empty source_URL.
            
0.06      2011-01-11 19:47:25 America/Denver
          Fixes:
          - Adjust basic.t to use the contents when it checks 
            if one has an Internet connection.  This will prevent
            tests from dyeing when trying to get raw_data

          Fixes:
          - Adding XML::Validate::LibXML as a dep. was not enough.
            Need to add XML::LibXML directly.

          Fixes:
          - XML::LibXML dependency (caused test to fail)
          
0.03      2010-12-29 20:35:22 America/Denver
          Improvements:
          - enlargen private parts (the dilemma of POD for _subs)
          - Test multiple location types
          
0.02      2010-12-29 14:28:29 America/Denver
          Improvements:
          - Add raw_data attribute that has the raw XML
          - Validate XML before using just in case.
          - improve Synopsis
